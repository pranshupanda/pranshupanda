I'm Pranshu, a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Minnesota, graduating in Spring 2026. I am motivated to design novel machine learning methods inspired by practical challenges, grounding abstract principles in real-world contexts and using iterative experimentation to guide their development. 
Currently, under the mentorship of Assistant Professor Aryan Deshwal, I work on probabilistic machine learning methods to accelerate scientific discovery, with a focus on Bayesian Optimization in discrete domains and real-world applications such as protein design. I am also a Research Intern at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, where I am implementing a Bayesian Optimization pipeline to tune cache management policy hyperparameters, improving system throughput via data-driven configuration search in a black-box setting. Previously, as a Software Engineering Intern at Stryker, I was responsible for fine-tuning Computer Vision models in a healthcare setting.

## Skills
 * **Languages:** Python, C, Java, OCaml, x86 Assembly, HTML/CSS, shell
 * **AI/ML Concepts:** Probabilistic Modelling, Uncertainty Quantification, Supervised/Unsupervised Learning, LLMs
 * **Libraries/Frameworks/Tools:** PyTorch, GPyTorch, BoTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Git

## Projects 
* **Fine-Tuning of Transformers with LoRA: A Comparative Study**  
  Benchmarked Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) against full-model and head-only fine-tuning on SST-2 and IMDB; demonstrated that
  LoRA achieves superior accuracy on SST-2 (94.27% vs 93.81%) and parity on IMDB (~95.5%), validating PEFT as a robust
  alternative to computationally expensive full fine-tuning.

* **Shortest Paths for Trivially Partitioned Graphs**  
  Optimized and analyzed Dijkstra’s Algorithm and A* Search using a hierarchical graph partitioning strategy, achieved up
  to a 52.7% runtime reduction on large trivially partitioned graphs.

* **Sample-Efficient Protein Design via Bayesian Optimization**  
  Designing a sample-efficient Bayesian optimization framework for discrete protein design, combining evolutionary search with
  categorical surrogates and evaluating on synthetic and life-science benchmarks to improve efficiency and runtime.  
  _Code coming soon_

* **Bayesian Optimization for Shared Cache Management in On-Chip Multiprocessors**  
  Designing and implementing a Bayesian Optimization pipeline to optimize shared cache management policy
  parameters, improving on-chip multiprocessor system performance via data-driven configuration search.  
  _Code coming soon_
